## Game Overview

You run a stall at a goblin market. Progress through 5 market tiers by:

1. **Buying** raw materials from suppliers
2. **Crafting** goods through minigames (Forge, RuneCraft)
3. **Selling** to fantasy customers via haggling
4. **Upgrading** your stall and unlocking new recipes

Every coin requires active play -- no idle mechanics.
